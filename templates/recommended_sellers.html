        <h2>Armani Beauty</h2>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='armani.png') }}" alt="Best Makeup Brands Image">
        <p>
            <strong>The brand:</strong> This international fashion house is also a key player on the luxury beauty scene, and has been ever since they first launched in 2000. The makeup takes a cue from the fashion, with the same timeless, classic vibe, not to mention incredibly high-performing formulas. And yes, ICYW, Mr. Armani himself is in fact very involved.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The hero product:</strong> Arguably one of the most iconic complexion products of all time, there’s a good reason why Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation is a true cult-classic, a staple for pro makeup artists and devoted customers alike. It’s surprisingly versatile, easily sheered out, or built-up depending on how you apply it, though always delivers a velvety-yet-radiant finish. This was the brand’s first product and to celebrate the recent 20th anniversary, they also added 10 new shades to the line, bringing the total up to 40.<br><strong>Price at time of publish:</strong> $69
             <br><strong>Coverage</strong>: Medium | <strong>Shade Range:</strong> 40 | <strong>Finish:</strong> Natural | <strong>Size:</strong> 1 oz. | <strong>Cruelty-Free:</strong> No
        </p>

        <h2>Fenty Beauty</h2>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='fenty.png') }}" alt="Best Makeup Brands Image">
        <p>
            <strong>The brand:</strong>We now think of Rihanna as a mega beauty boss, perhaps even more so than as a music superstar. She launched Fenty Beauty back in 2017, inspired by the lack of shade inclusivity in the industry. Not surprisingly, complexion products are a staple for this brand and come in an expansive range of colors; the foundation made major news when it launched with 40 different shades. (PS: Her latest launch, Fenty Skin, is equally impressive.) 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The hero product:</strong> Speaking of, Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation is a must-try. The shade range is of course impressive (it now comes in 50 colors), but so is the actual formula itself. Despite the full coverage and a matte finish, it feels incredibly lightweight and velvety on the skin, blurring out lines, blemishes, and generally leaving your complexion looking flawless.<br><strong>Price at time of publish:</strong> $40
             <br><strong>Coverage</strong>Medium to full | <strong>Shade Range:</strong> 50 | <strong>Finish:</strong> Soft matte | <strong>Size:</strong> 1.08 oz. | <strong>Cruelty-Free:</strong> Yes
        </p>

        <h2>Pat McGrath Labs</h2>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='pat.png') }}" alt="Best Makeup Brands Image">
        <p>
            <strong>The brand:</strong>There’s no ifs, ands, or buts about it—Pat McGrath is a legend, arguably one of the most prolific makeup artists of all time. A mainstay for fashion shows around the world, she partnered with multiple brands before finally launching her eponymous line in 2015. This is a brand for girls who love makeup and want that same edgy, editorially look McGrath is known for, think holographic shadows and gilded lips. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The hero product:</strong>McGrath is well-known for transforming everyday skin into a glassy, glowy masterpiece, and with this Skin Fetish Highlighter & Balm Duo you can do the same. The dual-ended stick touts a transparent, ultra-creamy balm on one end and a shimmery, equally-creamy highlight shade on the other. Pair the two together for ultimate dewy radiance, or use them solo.<br><strong>Price at time of publish:</strong> $50
             <br><strong>Coverage</strong>Medium to full | <strong>Shade Range:</strong> 50 | <strong>Finish:</strong> Soft matte | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.11 oz. (balm), 0.12 | <strong>Cruelty-Free:</strong> No
